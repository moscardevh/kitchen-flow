# Kitchen Flow

Kitchen Flow is a restaurant operations app (starting in Java) focused on improving order flow from chat channels (e.g. WhatsApp) into kitchen production.

## Current status
- **Refactored**: Generic `MenuItem` class with price and category support
- **Removed**: Specific `Pizza` class (now using category system)
- **Menu stored**: `ArrayList<MenuItem>` with proper pricing
- **Console output**: Formatted display with category, ingredients and prices
- **Learned**: Java inheritance, refactoring, and polymorphism concepts

## How to run (for now)
From `src/`:
- Compile: `javac *.java`
